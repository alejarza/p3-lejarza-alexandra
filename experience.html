        <h1>Educational and Professional Experience</h1>
        <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>As an educator in higher ed, I tell my students that you will know what your major is when you are excited to read the textbook and happy to go to class. That's how I learned <span style="color: #d3949f;font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold">Psychology</span> was for me. I received  Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology at the <a href="https://welcome.miami.edu" target="_blank">University of Miami</a> with 3 minors in French, English, and Family & Human Services. This track naturally led me to develop an interest in counseling. Making individuals more aware of the influence of mental health on our well-being became a priority. I received a Master of Science degree in <span style="color: #d3949f;font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold">Counselor Education</span> at <a href="https://www.fiu.edu" target="_blank">Florida International University</a>.</p>
          <p>Working in a college, it made sense to enroll in a doctoral program in <span style="color: #d3949f;font-size: 20px;font-weight:bold">Higher Education</span> to help fulfill what I felt was missing in my career. Based on my work as an educator, my qualitative study focused on the lived experiences of female academic advisors. Through semi-structured interviews, the women discussed their career aspirations, interpersonal relationships between coworkers, and their day-to-day duties. In part, the research intended to highlight an important group of people who are sometimes overlooked in higher education research: staff members.</p>
          <p>Below is a short summary of the roles I currently hold, as well as some of the skills I have cultivated over the years.</p>

        <h2>Current Roles</h2>
        <img src="images/lds.jpg" alt="Learning Disability Specialist" width="100">
        <p>Since 2018, I have been assisting college students with documented disabilities. I review medical records and psychological evaluations and provide recommended accommodations to promote student success. I am often tasked with creating training materials, handouts, and messages that help communicate important information about the department.</p>
        <img src="images/ap.jpg" alt="Adjunct Professor" width="100">
        <p>I teach a variety of Psychology classes to undergraduate students (my favorite is Human Growth and Development!). Due to the demands of my full-time work schedule and graduate school, I typically teach on Saturday mornings. However, being in the classroom is one of my favorite things and it never feels like a job.</p>
        <img src="images/gs.jpg" alt="Graduate Student" width="100">
        <p>In 2020, I decided to challenge myself so I dove into the world of technology and design. I am currently enrolled in a Master's program through the <a href="http://www.ufl.edu" target="_blank">University of Florida</a> in Mass Communication (with a concentration in Web Design). I plan to finish my degree in the Spring of 2022.</p>
